## Algorithms & Data Structures problems using C/C++
> Data Structures problem are well covered in the coursesection in c & c++. This repository contains programs of various introductory data structures concepts and source codes implemented in C/C++ programming language.

## CMake Complication process
1. Create the build folder using the commands 
   
   -> cmake -B/home/vikrant/Data_Structures_Algorithms/build -H/home/vikrant/Data_Structures_Algorithms

2. Go to the build/src folder , run make and it will build a executable file which can be run via command prompt.
   
    ->./core

3. Make sure to include the header file in headerfile.h in inc folder to complie specify data structures problem & include that specific file in cmakelist

## Data Structures Problems
| Problem | Solution |
| :------------ | :----------: |
| Create a linked list to store the ID & names of the employes dynamically , Search the Info of employee & Delete the data of the employee. |[linkedlist.c](https://github.com/vikrantdeveloper/Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/master/src/linkedlist.c)
|Sort a given array using three sorting algos - Insert sort ,selection sort & bubble sort|[sorting.c](https://github.com/vikrantdeveloper/Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/master/src/sorting.c)
